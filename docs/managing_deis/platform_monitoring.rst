Platform monitoring
===================

While Deis itself doesn't have a built-in monitoring system, Deis components and deployed
applications alike run entirely within Docker containers. This means that monitoring tools and
services which support Docker containers should work with Deis. A few tools and monitoring services
which support Docker integrations are detailed below.

Tools
-----

cadvisor
~~~~~~~~

Google's Container Advisor (`cadvisor`_) runs inside a Docker container and shows memory and CPU
usage for all containers running on the host. To run cAdvisor:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo docker run \
    --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
    --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
    --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
    --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
    --publish=8080:8080 \
    --detach=true \
    --name=cadvisor \
    google/cadvisor:latest

To run cAdvisor on all hosts in the cluster, you can submit and start a fleet service:

.. code-block:: console

    [Unit]
    Description=Google Container Advisor
    Requires=docker.socket
    After=docker.socket

    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "docker history google/cadvisor:latest >/dev/null || docker pull google/cadvisor:latest"
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --volume=/:/rootfs:ro --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw --volume=/sys:/sys:ro --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro --publish=8080:8080 --name=cadvisor google/cadvisor:latest

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    [X-Fleet]
    Global=true

Save the file as ``cadvisor.service``. Load and start the service with
``fleetctl load cadvisor.service && fleetctl start cadvisor.service``.

The web interface will be accessible at port 8080 on each host.

In addition to starting a cAdvisor instance on each CoreOS host, there's also a project called
`heapster`_ from the Google Cloud Platform team, which seems to be a cluster-aware cAdvisor.

Monitoring services
-------------------

These are a few monitoring services which are known to provide Docker integrations.
Additions to this reference guide are much appreciated!

Datadog
~~~~~~~

The `Datadog`_ cloud monitoring service provides a monitor agent which runs on the host and provides
metrics for all Docker containers (which is functionally similar to cAdvisor's implementation).
See `this blog post`_ for details. The `Datadog agent`_ for Docker can be run on a single host as
follows:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run -d --privileged --name dd-agent -h `hostname` -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /proc/mounts:/host/proc/mounts:ro -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -e API_KEY=YOUR_REAL_API_KEY datadog/docker-dd-agent

Be sure to substitute ``YOUR_REAL_API_KEY`` for your Datadog API key.

To run Datadog for the entire cluster, you can submit and start a fleet service (again, substitute ``YOUR_REAL_API_KEY``):

.. code-block:: console

    [Unit]
    Description=Datadog
    Requires=docker.socket
    After=docker.socket

    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "docker history datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest >/dev/null || docker pull datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest"
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --privileged --name dd-agent -h %H -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /proc/mounts:/host/proc/mounts:ro -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -e API_KEY=YOUR_REAL_API_KEY datadog/docker-dd-agent

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    [X-Fleet]
    Global=true

Save the file as ``datadog.service``. Load and start the service with
``fleetctl load datadog.service && fleetctl start datadog.service``.

Shortly thereafter, you should start to see metrics from your Deis cluster appear in your Datadog dashboard.

New Relic
~~~~~~~~~

The `New Relic`_ monitoring service's agent will run on the CoreOS host and report metrics to New Relic.

Unlike Datadog, however, the agent running on the host doesn't send metrics for individual containers
unless those containers have been built with a Dockerfile that installs their own instance of the agent.

The Deis community's own Johannes WÃ¼rbach has developed a fleet service for New Relic in his
`newrelic-sysmond`_ repository.
